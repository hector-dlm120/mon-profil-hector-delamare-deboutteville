<p>
I come from a boarding school where I was able to develop my capabilities of working in groups and learning to live with a group. I am a first year student in Ieseg, school of business in the CPGE course. Doing a master in Finance is my main objective in the span of the next three years. I am someone really entousiastic in my projects and who likes creating, that is why I could disinterest myself of some objectives to accomplish the main ones.

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
I have been playing the guitar for the past 8 years and I even gave lessons to debutants. Thanks to that, music has become one of my passions and I continue playing it even tho I live in Lille.

<h2>Scoutism</h2>
<p>
When I was a child, my parents brought me in this environnement, and I never came out. Even now, I am in charge of the young kids who enter scoutism, to give back what others gave me.
